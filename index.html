		<p>The Enterprise Platform Team focuses on building and maintaining the Infinity platform which serves as the foundation for Blackbaud CRM &mdash; an Enterprise-scale CRM solution &mdash; as well as multiple mid-market hosted products. </p>

		<p>As a team lead, I am the front line for my team when dealing with thorny production issues that range from helping our hosting services team diagnose environmental problems to providing developer support for customer-written customizations on top of our platform. In this role, I've worked closely with our product support and product management teams to ensure that 
		I am always providing a customer-focused solution.</p>

		<p>I also provide guidance to other teams building new product features on the Infinity platform, help architect and guide new platform 
			feature development, participate in user discovery, research new UX techniques, and perform code reviews for both my team and others.</p>

		<p>And this is all done without breaking compatibility for a large swathe of customizations written by both our clients and our 
			internal professional services team.</p>

		<p>By taking a broad survey of the current practices in the industry during my off-hours, I'm able to recognize new opportunities and possibilities when 
			on the clock.</p>
